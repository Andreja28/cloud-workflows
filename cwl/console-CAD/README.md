# console-CAD workflow



Input in a workflow is a `.txt` file (as an example there is `input.txt` provided in this repository). The name of that file must be specified in the `.yaml` file that needs to be uploaded to the [FES_API](https://github.com/Andreja28/FES-API). Zipped inputs field is a `.zip` file that contains inputs in the workflow (for example `.zip` containing `input.txt`).
