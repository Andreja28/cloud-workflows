# MUSICO - CWL workflow

![Workflow](https://github.com/Andreja28/cloud-workflows/blob/master/cwl/musico-cwl/musico.png)

Input in a workflow is a `.zip` file that musico takes as an input (as an example there is `GC11.zip` provided in this repository). The name of that file must be specified in the `.yaml` file that needs to be uploaded to the FES_API[https://github.com/Andreja28/FES-API]. Zipped inputs field is a `.zip` file that contains inputs in the workflow (for example `.zip` containing `GC11.zip`).
